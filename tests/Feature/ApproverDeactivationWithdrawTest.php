 * for a REAL document, routed the normal way via
 * WorkflowService::routeToWorkflow() -> assignStage(), which seats EVERY
 * eligible approver on a stage at once (the unanimous-approval model).
 * Under that real flow, every other eligible approver already holds their
 * own seat by the time one gets deactivated, so findReplacementApprover()
 * almost never finds anyone — this used to silently fall through to an
 * Admin escalation every time, even when a sibling approver already fully
 * covered the stage. These tests cover the fix: withdraw with no Admin
 * involvement when a real sibling exists, escalate only when nobody's left.
