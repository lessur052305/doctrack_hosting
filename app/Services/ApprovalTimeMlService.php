/**
 * Trains one Ridge Regression model per (category, department) combo,
 * predicting how long the NEXT decision in that combo will take. Two
 * features: the deciding approver's own historical average speed
 * (leave-one-out, so a row is never used to predict itself) and the day
 * of week — genuinely learnable signal, not just echoing the target back
 * at itself. Runs fully automatically (see TrainTimeEstimateModels) —
 * there is deliberately no manual "train now" control.
 *
 * Ridge, not plain Linear Regression — see App\Support\RidgeRegression's
 * own docblock for the mechanism, but in short: it stays conservative
 * when there's little data to constrain it (fewer real decisions, more
 * room for one unusual outlier to skew a plain fit), and automatically
 * trusts the data more as more real decisions accumulate — exactly the
 * "works reasonably from a small sample, gets sharper as data grows"
 * property MIN_TRAINING_SAMPLES alone can't provide on its own.
 *
 * See ApprovalForecastService's docblock for why THAT stays a plain
 * statistical average — this is the genuine ML regression counterpart,
 * gated behind having enough real history (MIN_TRAINING_SAMPLES) to mean
 * anything more than noise. Estimates for stages beyond the immediate
 * next one still fall back to that plain average, since we don't know in
 * advance which department will end up handling those.
