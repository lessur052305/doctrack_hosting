// Reverb speaks the Pusher protocol, so Echo is configured with the
// 'reverb' broadcaster (a thin preset over the same client) rather than a

// server, no external SaaS dependency.

// Private channels (every channel in routes/channels.php is private) POST
// to /broadcasting/auth to prove the visitor is who they claim before
// Reverb allows the subscription. That route sits behind Laravel's normal
// CSRF protection like any other POST, so the request needs the token —
// without this `auth.headers` block, the browser's subscription silently
// fails 419 and no live update (dashboards OR the notification bell) ever
// arrives, since there's no `window.axios` configured anywhere in this
// app to inject the header automatically the way a stock Laravel
// bootstrap.js would.

// wsHost: prefer the build-time VITE_REVERB_HOST, but only when it's a
// real, distinct hostname — fall back to window.location.hostname when
// it's a same-machine placeholder (localhost/127.0.0.1).
//
// Two deployment shapes need to both work here:
//   1. Local self-hosting — Reverb runs on the SAME machine as the web
//      app, just a different port. REVERB_HOST is baked in as
//      "localhost" at build time, which means something different
//      depending on which device loads the page (on a phone, "localhost"
//      means the phone, not the server). window.location.hostname fixes
//      this — it always resolves to whatever address the browser
//      actually used to reach the page (127.0.0.1, localhost, or a LAN
//      IP), which is correct since Reverb listens on 0.0.0.0 there too.
//   2. Split hosting (e.g. Railway) — Reverb runs as a genuinely
//      SEPARATE service with its own distinct public domain, different
//      from the web app's domain. Here window.location.hostname is
//      actively wrong (it's the web app's own domain, which doesn't
//      speak the Reverb protocol) — the real, baked-in VITE_REVERB_HOST
//      must be used as-is.
