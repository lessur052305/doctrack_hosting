{{--
    Full workflow-stage pipeline for this document's category (Feature:
    show every stage, not just whichever one currently "pops up"). Every
    configured stage for the category is listed and its state derived from
    however many assignment rows (seats — one per eligible approver, see
    WorkflowService::assignStage()) exist for it:
      - no assignment rows yet                  -> "upcoming" (not yet reached)
      - any seat rejected                       -> "rejected"
      - zero seats pending, none rejected        -> "approved"/"auto_approved"
      - otherwise (1+ seats still pending)       -> "pending", with a
        "N of M approved" progress line once a stage has more than one seat.

    Highlighting (Feature: approver can see which stages are theirs at a
    glance): when the viewer is an approver, their own pending seat(s) for
    this document are highlighted in primary blue instead of the neutral
    orange used for other approvers' pending stages. If they hold pending
    seats on more than one stage, only the earliest (lowest sequence_order)
    is marked "Your turn" — that's the one the action button elsewhere on
    the page acts on. Their other stage(s) are marked "Up next" — visible,
    but not yet actionable until the current one resolves.

    Explicit override (Feature: Admin SLA Override Queue): the viewer isn't
    the assigned approver, so the auth-based highlighting above never
    fires. Pass $highlightAssignmentId to force the ONE SPECIFIC SEAT that
    assignment belongs to into the same highlighted style (assignment-
    scoped, not stage-scoped, since a stage can now have some escalated
    seats and some non-escalated seats at once) — labeled "Escalated"
    rather than "Your turn" since it isn't the viewer's own assignment.

    Originator-directed routing (Feature: bypass the standard pipeline —
    see WorkflowService::routeToCustomApprovers()): a custom-routed
    document never touches the category's configured pipeline at all, so
    showing it here would list stages that will never actually happen as
    if they're still coming ("Not yet reached" forever). Below, this
    shows ONLY the document's own one-off stage(s) in that case instead
    of the category-wide list — see desired_routing's branch.
